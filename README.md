# urban-octo-guacamole
*(the name means nothing; github suggested it and it was too good to not use)*

An extension of the work I've been doing on pathfinding within learning maps (c.f. [here](http://geekdome.net/swagmapgen/)), combined with work done at Akamai on automatic generation of learning goals (map destinations) based on a list of desired skills.  

For best results, clone and then view the slides with `nbconvert --to slides --post serve OctoGuac.ipynb`, though the slides are still intended to accompany a live presentation. For now they're mostly here for me so I can build them into something friendlier later.
